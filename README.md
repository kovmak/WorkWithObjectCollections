# Practical Work No. 5

**Topic:** Working with Collections of Objects  
**Objective:** Develop skills in creating collections. Learn to select and use the appropriate collection implementation in the Collections Framework. Master the basic functions of working with collections. Get acquainted with Generics and Stream API.

## Tasks

1. **Research Java Collections Performance:**
   Investigate the differences between various types of collections and typical operations with them: CRUD, filter, sort, find, concat, reduce, match, counting, sum, average.

2. **Display Results in Tables:**
   Show the resulting tables of time intervals, sorted by the best time performance.

3. **Test with Large Data Sets:**
   Create tests with large amounts of data (50k, 500k, 1 million).

4. **Use Primitive Data Types and Custom Objects:**
   Form data from primitive data types and custom objects.

5. **Color Scheme for Text Output (Optional):**
   Apply a color scheme to the text output as desired.

6. **Types of Collections to Use:**
   Utilize the primary collections from the interfaces List, Set, Queue, Map. Use at least 8 types of collections.

7. **Example Study:**
   Refer to the example study: [Collection Performance Comparison](https://korzh.net/2010-11-proizvoditelnost-osnovnyx-kollekcij-java-sravnenie-s-analogami-net.html) for understanding the subject area and forming general theses to investigate.

8. **Perform All Tasks Using Stream API:**

9. **Success Criteria for Research:**
   Ensure your tests meet the performance criteria as outlined in this [comparison study](https://medium.com/omarelgabrys-blog/data-structures-a-quick-comparison-6689d725b3b0).

10. **Parallel Stream:**
    Execute all the above tasks using parallelStream and show the results.

11. **Stream API Task:**
    Choose any task from Codewars that involves Stream API.
